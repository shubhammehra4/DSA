/*
 What we are essentially doing is going in the direction of the rising slope(by choosing the 
 element which is greater than current). How does that guarantee the result? => 
 
 a) rising slope has to keep rising till end of the array 
 b) rising slope will encounter a lesser element and go down.
 In a) the answer is the end element because we take the boundary as -INFINITY 
 b) the answer is the largest element before the slope falls. Hope this makes things clearer.
